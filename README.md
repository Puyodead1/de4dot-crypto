# de4dot-crypto
backup of a modified de4dot that works for crypto obfuscator

This is a backup of the modified de4dot version I found, I was doing some reverse engineering on a game that used crypto obfuscator and the original de4dot had some error that this version resolved. I found this version on a youtube video which has sadly since been removed, luckly I had a copy so I am posting it here mainly for my future self or anyone else that may stumble upon this.

Note: I DID NOT MAKE THIS, nor did i verify that its not malicious, so use at your own risk.
